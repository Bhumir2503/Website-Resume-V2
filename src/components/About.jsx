      <p>Taking that computer science class in high school opened up a whole new universe for me. Suddenly, coding felt like <strong>decoding a secret language</strong>â€”I couldn't get enough. Late nights turned into early mornings as I tinkered with programs, debugged endlessly, and felt that <strong>rush of satisfaction</strong> when everything fell into place. From that moment on, computer science became <strong>more than a hobby</strong>; it became a cornerstone of my life, propelling me to dive deeper into various realms of this field, <strong>eager to absorb everything</strong> it had to offer.</p>
